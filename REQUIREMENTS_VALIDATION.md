* Consistency and Completeness Checks:



After reviewing the project requirements, the following observations were made:



##### Consistency:



* Patient records must be accessible across all hospitals using the platform.



* Role-based access is consistently applied for patients, doctors, and administrators.



* Security measures, including encryption and HTTPS/TLS, are consistently mentioned across all system components.





##### Completeness:



* Core functionality (authentication, patient record management, hospital access) is clearly defined.



* Reporting and analytics requirements are outlined, though specific report types and metrics need further detailing.



* Future work items, such as mobile app integration, AI-based analysis tools, and IoT device support, are acknowledged but lack detailed requirements.





##### Identified Risks Related to Requirements:



* Incomplete Definition of Reporting Requirements



Risk: The reporting module may not meet hospital needs due to vague requirements.



Impact: Reports may fail to provide actionable insights, reducing system effectiveness.



* Integration with Multiple Hospitals



Risk: Hospitals may have varied data formats or legacy systems that the platform must integrate with.



Impact: Data inconsistencies or sharing failures may occur if requirements are not precise.





##### Proposed Validation Methods:



* Prototyping



Develop mockups of the user interface and core modules for feedback from doctors and administrators.



* Requirement Reviews



Conduct formal review sessions with stakeholders to ensure requirements are clear, complete, and feasible.



* Test Cases



Create test cases to validate functional requirements:



Authentication and role-based access function correctly for all users.



Patient records can be created, updated, and shared securely across hospitals.



Reporting module generates correct and accurate data for analysis.



* Simulation Testing



Use simulated hospital data to validate system security, scalability, and data-sharing capabilities before deployment.





##### Deliverable



This document serves as the official Requirements Validation Report for the MedLink project, ensuring that the system requirements are consistent, complete, and validated against potential risks.
